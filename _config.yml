        quote: >
          Built a new system for quantifying the minimum concentration of wastewater solids at which sedimentation in settling tanks cause poor water quality. Also known as Limit of Stokesian Settling (LOSS)

          - Developed a method to help plant operators mitigate clarifier failures, and enhance wastewater effluent quality
          - Designed a unique R algorithm to convert 100’s of images of settling wastewater (in 2-liter jars) to color indexes in order to analyze light penetration through the jar
          - Implemented 3 mathematical models in R to process color indexes based on regression analysis, sigmoid fitting and mean deviation of light through the jar

          - Led daily experiments to assess wastewater quality from the pilot and the plant’s mainstream channels
          - Developed R algorithms code to analyze the hourly data
          - Implemented C++ algorithms to control microbial wasting, water, aeration, Proportional, Integral and Derivative (PID) tuning, based on a target OUR range

          - Proposed that bringing in Rock bands should be the next business venture as they garnered over 50% of tracks sold
          - Advocated to expand marketing efforts in India, due to the large population (over 1.3 billion) and one of the highest customer average lifetime purchases ($91.58)

          - Established connection between SAT scores and socio-economic factors in each borough
          - Ascertained that African-American and Hispanic students were 16% more likely to perform worse in SAT exams, due to a majority of their residence in low income districts
          - Discovered that schools in more suburban areas (Staten Island & Queens) were likely to perform better in SAT exams than those in the city

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.
      <center><img src="/images/mecirc.png" /></center>
      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
