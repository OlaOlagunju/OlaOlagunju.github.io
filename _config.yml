          # Designed a unique R algorithm to convert 100â€™s of images of settling wastewater (in 2-liter jars) to color indexes in order to analyze light penetration through the jar
          Implemented 3 mathematical models in R to process color indexes based on regression analysis, sigmoid fitting and mean deviation of light through the jar
	  Constructed a method to help plant operators mitigate clarifier failures, and enhance wastewater effluent quality
