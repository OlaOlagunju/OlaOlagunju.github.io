  Write an awesome description about yourself here, this supports markdown, so you can add [links](http://foobar.com) and highlight things <mark>like this</mark>.

  You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started#what-is-markdown) supports such as
    - Lists
    - Tables
    - <a href="google.com">Links</a>

        quote: >
          Built a new system for quantifying the minimum concentration of wastewater solids at which sedimentation in settling tanks cause poor water quality. Also known as Limit of Stokesian Settling (LOSS)

          - Constructed a method to help plant operators mitigate clarifier failures, and enhance wastewater effluent quality
          - Designed a unique R algorithm to convert 100’s of images of settling wastewater (in 2-liter jars) to color indexes in order to analyze light penetration through the jar
          - Implemented 3 mathematical models in R to process color indexes based on regression analysis, sigmoid fitting and mean deviation of light through the jar

          - Led daily experiments to assess wastewater quality from the pilot and the plant’s mainstream channels
          - Developed R algorithms code to analyze the hourly data
          - Implemented C++ algorithms to control microbial wasting, water, aeration, Proportional, Integral and Derivative (PID) tuning, based on a target OUR range

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.
      
      <p align="center">
      <img src="/images/mecirc.png" />
      </p>

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
